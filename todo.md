        EDU logo
        Drone image
        Object-class diagram
        Workflow diagram
        Agile product table
        Other relevant images

2. Update the HTML Structure

    Create new sections in the HTML document.
    Organize the paragraphs within these sections.
    Add the images in their respective sections for better visual representation.

3. Commit Changes with Specific Message for Automation

    When committing changes, use the message "sync_agmdm" to ensure automatic deployment of the changes to the website.
    Example commit command:
    `git commit -m "Paragraph updated sync_agmdm"`
    This will trigger the automation server to update the site with the changes.
